![Website on multiple screens](media/README.md-images/README.md-multiple-screens.png)

**[Cockapoo Club, Dublin Ireland](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com)** was developed and submmitted as my fourth Profile Portfolio Project as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in full-stack software development course. 

This project introduces a new range of features and funcionalities that offer Users a valuable expansion on my first Profile Portfolio Project, which centred on a fictional webiste for an online community of dog owners called 'Cockapoo Club'. The progress made in this iteration of the original concept includes the addition of Django, CRUD functionality, as well as other new features that evolved out of ideas for delivering signifcant improvements and a fuller experience for Users of this website.

## **Summary**
  This social platform provides users with an opportunity to connect and share photogpraphs, and even information about owning, training and taking care of a breed of dog called Cockapoos, one of Ireland's newest, most popular and much-loved dog breeds. 
  
  Unlike many other social media platforms that provide a similar expereince, this project offers users a unique way to create and participate in their own community of likeminded pet owners.    

The site targets users around the world who:

* may already have a Cockapoo dog and need more information about taking care of their dog. 

* may be thinking about getting a new Cockapoo dog and require more information to make their decision.
