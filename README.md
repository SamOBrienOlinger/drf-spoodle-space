# SpoodleSpace - Backend
# ![**SpoodleSPACE**](Media/README.md-images/README.md-paulpuppy.jpg)


[**SpoodleSpace**](spoodle-space-pp5.herokuapp.com) uses [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org) to serve as its API to interface with its frontend [React](https://www.npmjs.com) JavaScript library. 

This project evolved out of a project, which centred around a fictional online community of dog owners called '**[Cockapoo Club](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com)**'.

This project introduces an entirely new concept. The main site goal is to provide Users with a really positive, engaging and interactive experience. 
This expansion combines my proficiencies across **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**; involving **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **Django REST Framework**.

# NB ðŸš§ Site Temporarily Unavailable Due to Database Migration ðŸš§

Users are currently experiencing temporary downtime as I migrate the database from ElephantSQL to a new hosting service. This transition is necessary to improve the stability and performance of the site.

I am actively working to complete this migration and restore full functionality as quickly as possible. I am also evaluating options such as AWS to ensure a robust and scalable infrastructure for the future.

Thank you for your patience. I appreciate your understanding.

## **Summary**
  This social platform provides Users with an opportunity to connect and share photographs, and even information about owning, training and taking care of a breed of dog called Cockapoos, one of Ireland's newest, most popular and much-loved dog breeds. 
  
  Unlike many other social networking platforms, this project offers Users a unique way to create and participate in their own community of likeminded people with a shared identity that self-sustains itself. A fundamental intended outcome is to produces a sense of belonging that cannot be found elsewhere.    

The site is designed to engage as wide a range as possible of millions of potential Users around the world, including:

* families, couples and individuals who already have a Cockapoo or two that are eager to learn more about the history and nature of the breed of their fun furry companions. 

* folks who would like to find out more about taking care of their dog so their hairy little buddy stays happy and healthy. 

* anyone considering opening their home to a new companion of this breed of dog and are hoping to gather more information to help make their decision. 

 * Cockapoo owners who enjoy connecting with other Cockapoo owners by sharing funny stories,  photographs and videos of their adventures.

* Anyone who is looking for some support and/or who can provide otyher with support related to any challenges they are facing with the behaviour of their loved little clowns!  


Given the site goals outlined here, enhancing the UI and UX to achieve the project's most important goals required prioritising the way backend data connected with the front-end application.

 ### [Testing](#testing)

  Comprehensive manual testing was carried out to guarantee that Users without the necessary permissions would not have Write Access. 
  It was a fundamental priority to restrict Users from having the ability to create, update, or delete data; or perform actions that could jeopardize sensitive data; or modify the system's state through adding new records, editing existing content, or making changes to configuration settings.


Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) functionality across this API was tested manually. This ensured that the database and handling of data worked as expected when Users manipulated data on the frontend React app.
All apps passed the tests conducted for verifying the intended backend functionality. For more details on each test visit the **testing.md** file found **[here](/testing.md)**.

Backend manual testing used throughout each stage of development helped guarantee that the acceptance criteria set out in each of the User Stories was achieved. These User Stories can be found **[here](https://github.com/users/SamOBrienOlinger/projects/3)** in Github Projects. 

For further details of testing carried out on the React frontend relevant to verifying the backend functionality, please visit the **[frontend repository README.md file](https://github.com/SamOBrienOlinger/spoodle-space-pp5/blob/main/README.md)** and **[frontend repository testing.md file](https://github.com/SamOBrienOlinger/spoodle-space-pp5/blob/main/testing.md)**.


**Python Validation**

Code Institute's CI Python Linter was used to validate all Python code. Every app passed without errors, except for E501 'line too long' warnings, an example of this can be seen below:

![Python validator](Media/README.md-images/README.md-ci-linter.jpg)


**Fixed Bugs**

  Migrated changes to models.py files caused the most problems overall. Although the data did exist in the [database](https://www.elephantsql.com/), the database was corrupted and had to be delete entirely. 
  A new instance needed to be created and connected to the API. The env.py file and Heroku Config Vars were updated accordingly. The important learning from idenitifying the cause and then the solution to this problem was understanding that the issue was caused by a migration that altered a model -from having an owner = ForeignKey when a OneToOneField was required instead.

### [Deployment](#deployment) 

Creating a database using ElephantSQL was first required. The following steps were taken to do this: 

- login to ElephantSQL.

- click 'Create new instance' on the dashboard.

- name the 'plan' and select the 'Tiny Turtle' option.

- select 'select region' and choose the nearest data centre to your location.

- click 'Review'.

- then go to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the 'database instance name' for this project.

- copy the ElephantSQL database URL to your clipboard.

- Return to the Heroku dashboard.

**Current Bugs**

- There is a temporary change to the Config Vars in Heroku. 
The DATABASE_URL requires updating to another database provider. The database is being migrated to Supabase drom ElephantSQL. 

This project was deployed through Heroku using the following steps:

- Log into Heroku
- Select 'Create New App' from your dashboard
- Choose an app name
- Select the appropriate region based on your location
- Click 'Create App'

- On your dashboard, click the 'Deploy' tab
- Locate 'Deployment Method' and choose 'GitHub'
- locate your repository then click 'Connect'

- Click the 'Settings' tab
- Open the 'Config Vars' and click 'Reveal Config Vars'

- The following environment variables need to be added and match the same values in your env.py file:
    - CLIENT_ORIGIN
    - CLOUDINARY_URL
    - DATABASE_URL
    - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
    - SECRET_KEY

- install psycopg2 and dj-database-urlth libraries to handle database connection.
- configured dj-rest-auth library for JWTs
- set allowed hosts
- configured CORS:
  - set allowed_origins

- gitignore the env.py file
- generate a requirements.txt file

once all the variables are in place, choose the main branch and click 'Deploy Branch'.
Once the build is finished, click 'Open App' located at the top of the page.
