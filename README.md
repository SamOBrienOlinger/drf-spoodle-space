# SpoodleSpace‚ÄìBackend

![SpoodleSPACE](Media/README.md-images/README.md-paulpuppy.jpg)

[**SpoodleSpace**](https://spoodle-space-pp5.herokuapp.com) is a Django REST Framework API that powers the frontend React app, delivering a full social platform for Cockapoo dog owners and enthusiasts.

Originally inspired by [Cockapoo Club](https://home-cockapoo-club-pp4.herokuapp.com), this project expands the idea into a more engaging, interactive, and scalable experience using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **Django REST Framework**.

## Summary

This social platform allows users to connect, share photographs, and exchange information about caring for Cockapoos ‚Äî one of Ireland‚Äôs most beloved dog breeds.

Unlike typical social networks, this project fosters a shared identity and belonging within a niche community. It is designed to attract:

- Families, couples, or individuals who already own Cockapoos.
- People seeking guidance on training, health, or behaviour.
- Potential owners researching the breed.
- Owners wanting to share photos, stories, and adventures.
- Anyone looking for peer support from fellow dog lovers.

The backend plays a critical role in linking frontend components and ensuring smooth user experiences.

## Testing

Manual testing was carried out to:

- Restrict user access to protected actions.
- Verify full CRUD functionality in the API.
- Validate user story outcomes.

Refer to `/testing.md` for backend testing details.  
User stories and acceptance criteria are tracked in [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/SamOBrienOlinger/projects/3).  
Frontend testing can be found in the [frontend repo README](https://github.com/SamOBrienOlinger/spoodle-space-pp5/blob/main/README.md) and [testing.md](https://github.com/SamOBrienOlinger/spoodle-space-pp5/blob/main/testing.md).

### Python Validation

The Code Institute's CI Python Linter was used to validate all Python code.  
All apps passed validation except for `E501` long line warnings:

## Fixed Bugs

Model changes caused database inconsistencies.  
A `ForeignKey` field was mistakenly used instead of `OneToOneField`, corrupting migrations.  
Resolution involved deleting the old ElephantSQL DB, creating a new one, and updating `env.py` and Heroku Config Vars.

---

## Deployment

### Original ElephantSQL Setup

1. Log in to ElephantSQL.
2. Create a new instance (`Tiny Turtle` plan).
3. Choose nearest region.
4. Review and create.
5. Copy the database URL.
6. Add it to Heroku config vars.

### Heroku Deployment

1. Log in to Heroku.
2. Create a new app.
3. Set region and app name.
4. Link GitHub repo under **Deploy** tab.
5. Install required packages (`psycopg2`, `dj-database-url`, etc.).
6. Configure JWT, CORS, allowed hosts, etc.
7. Ignore `env.py`.
8. Generate `requirements.txt`.
